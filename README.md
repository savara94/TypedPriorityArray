# Coding school

Here, my fellow colleagues learn how to write code in Python through some OOP ideas and well known data structures & algorithms that I give them to implement.

For now, they have implemented:
1. Function (math expression evaluating class)
1. Priority queue (TypedPriorityArray)
1. Linked list

### Setup
1.  clone repository
1.  "cd coding_school"
1.  "python3 -m venv env"
1.  "source env/bin/activate"
1.  "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
1. "cd {project}"
1.  "./run_tests.sh {developer_name}" (Make sure virtual environment is active!)
    1.  For example, if your name is Tamara: "./run_tests.sh tamara"
    1.  You can also use your friend's name to check up on him
1.  After this, tests should run. Tests will be updated from time to time, so keep your files up to date.
1.  Your file is at: "{project}/src/{developer_name]}/"
1.  You should only change your file!
